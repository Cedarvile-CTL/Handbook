Vision for the Future
=====

As we aim to continue to innovate, we can also get bogged down by the required load we have on our plates.
We aim to use this space to document visions we have discussed for future development.


Identity and Purpose
--------------------

It sometimes seems that the norm for our institution is to reorganize. 
The last few years the CTL has been shifted from one structure to another, each with varying views on our usefulness.
These changes led to an unfortunate turnaround in employees, confusion for those who remained, 
  and confusion among faculty who would otherwise have benefited from our services.
Moving forward with a recently refreshed staff, we hope the future is a more stable, focused future. 


### Brief Historical Background

Since our birth in 2006 we have always had service to the full body of faculty at our University at heart. 
We believe faculty should be enabled to excel in their areas of expertise 
  and that support services for their scholarly and instructional work is greatly valued and needed.
We have met this need through servant-hearted support 
  that does not push technology on them
  but strives to find the tools or techniques that best achieve their goals. 
At times this has meant training them to use tools and techniques themselves; 
  other times it has meant partnering with them to complete the work or carry out their ideas.

As our University picked up the drive to build online programs in around 2010, 
  we were willing partners to build and support online courses.
Almost before we knew it, this work became all-consuming. 
And when new leadership came into our institution it was easy to assume 
  that building online courses was all we did. 
Several times we've been told to focus only on online courses 
  and have found our broader faculty without consistent support.
We've pushed back and stressed the need for broader service and support. 
We hope a clearer focus can be established for the longrun 
  that allows us to balance the ongoing need to build and support high-quality online courses 
  with the ever-present need to support the broader faculty 
  through technical support, consulting services, and creative production.


### Proposal for the Future

We have a name that might misrepresent both who we really are and who the University expects us to be. 
* We ARE:
  * a creative production, consulting, and support center for instructional and scholarly pursuits. 
  * good at building and supporting online courses.
  * good at handling competing time demands, managing complex projects, and shipping the final product often against the odds.
  * diversely talented in instructional design, instructional technology, 
    audio/video production, graphic design, technical and creative writing, 
    editing and proofreading, and web development.
* We CARE about:
  * active learning, deep learning, and engaging, learning-centered teaching strategies.
  * the intersection of usability and aesthetics in instructional materials.
  * the intersection of teaching and entertaining through instructional media.
  * blessing faculty through helping solve their technology problems, 
    brainstorming and building solutions to ideas they have, 
    and enabling their scholarly work.
  * fostering a positive work environment that includes good, hard work as well as fun-loving, redemptive comeradery.
  
All this said perhaps we... 
* are less of a high-brow teaching and learning center and more of a *practical innovational instructional solutions center*.
* can both build online courses *and serve broader faculty's instructionl needs as they arise*.
* can both support learning technologies online and *enable effective instructional technology use onground*.


Other Ideas
-----

### Incorporating an Agile Approach

When we returned from the eLearning Guild conference in Orlando in spring of 2015, 
  we had discussed ideas for how to make use of an agile process for project work.
This involved being comfortable with seeing some projects "MVP" (minimum viable product), 
  which we would pilot first and innovate with later.
We find ourselves increasing in situations beyond our control where this approach is necessary.
We hope to eventually incorporate more intentional reworking initiatives 
  as it is too easy to push through projects as MVP and not revise them.

### Instructional Support

We could be making more targeted efforts to reach out to departments, schools, programs
  to offer consulting and production services that help meet strategic needs in their areas.
This can be as simple as offering syllabus formatting and cleanup support 
  or as complex as working through strategic reworking of courses for improved outcomes or efficiency in offering.

### Instructional Media

We've shown a great capacity for creating engaging, high-quality, and reusable audio/video content.
We could be reaching out to specific programs and faculty members 
  who create excellent content to help them produce resuable video content.
Such efforts could both expand the University's influence and reputation 
  as well as increase sharing expertise across disciplines. 

For example, we recently built two videos for the Introduction to Humanities course 
  that covered the Elemnts of Visual Arts and Principles of Design. 
This material fits the needs in Humanities very well, 
  but it could also be beneficial in other courses 
  that include an introduction to such topics. 
With permission of the contributing subject matter experts and interest from such additional courses, 
  videos like this could be used to send a more consistent, scholarly message on such topics 
  from their most qualified sources on our campus.
  
### Employing and Developing Specialized Team Members

Many other institutions hire only instructional technologists in centers like ours.
We have been privileged to have creative staff as a core part of our team 
  from our birth up to the present day.
We believe that we've built unique, high-quality work as a result 
  of having such diverse and specialized talent as a part of our team.
At times our administration has questioned the value of such positions 
  against the more "efficient" use of templates and standard desktop publishing.

We hope that future leadership continues to advocate for creating solutions 
  that are not just vanilla implementations of the LMS or standard desktop publishing tools.
We hope that we can continue to intentionally target creative production in our projects 
  and push the envelope to create innovative solutions that engage the learner.
We believe this can be done with efficiency when appropriately skilled persons with specific skill sets 
  are employed and enabled to insert their talent and expertise in project process.
  
We believe that specialized team members can and should also be cross-trained in order to support each other. 
Specialized talent also takes special management effort to build into them, 
  seek inspiring projects for them, and allow them to experiment. 
All these aspects have been a part of successful and fruitful periods in our history.
  
### Custom Interactive Learning Solutions

We have had web development talent on staff in the past that has allowed us
  to build our own custom interactive web applications both for our own processes and for learning solutions.
While this approach involves a need for ongoing support and maintenance, 
  we have found it also is a fantastic way to meet specific instructional goals.
We hope that future leadership continues to value this approach, 
  carefully weighing what is lost before shutting down existing tools, 
  and thoughtfully investing in solutions that are flexible, usable, and truly appropriate for the given needs.
