Vision for the Future
=====

As we aim to continue to innovate, we can also get bogged down by the required load we have on our plates.
We aim to use this space to document visions we have discussed for future development.

### Incorporating and Agile Approach

When we returned from the eLearning Guild conference in Orlando in spring of 2015, we had discussed ideas for how to make use of an agile process for project work.
This involved being comfortable with seeing some projects "MVP" (minimum viable product), which we would pilot first and innovate with later.
We find ourselves increasing in situations beyond our control where this approach is necessary.
We hope to eventually incorporate more intentional reworking initiatives, as it is too easy to push through projects as MVP and not revise them.

### Instructional Support
We could be placing attention on researching key helpful technologies for common instructional tasks.
We can use what we learn to offer additional development events and perhaps to keep a blog.
