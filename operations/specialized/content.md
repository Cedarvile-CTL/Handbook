Content Development
===================

With several staff members possessing strong abilities for 
  proofreading, editing, and several forms of writing, we often aim to assist in developing quality content.
This can be simply taking the time to proof content we receive for online courses rather than just implementing them as-is.
It can also be as complex as assisting a professor with writing a textbook or even developing a script.

* Script-writing practices coming soon (DF).
