Resolving Issues Related to Online Development and Support
==========================================================

Overall Course Schedule Issues
------------------------------

Due to policies having changed several times in recent years, many of Cedarville's online courses use different schedules.
An initiative has been underway from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to create a single, simple schedule for all courses to follow.
Final resolution of this issue is pending, so diverse schedules remain.

The last known direction was:
* To run undergraduate courses during fall and spring semester on a 14-content-week schedule.
  This allows for 14 complete weeks of instruction,
    the "soft start" introduction week during the first partial week of the term,
    and flexibile to observe one or more full break weeks.



Weekly Schedule Issues
----------------------

* Course schedules should typically follow the [corresponding design patterns](index.md).
* Weekend deadlines should not be made for Saturdays in lieu of Sundays.
  Some may object due to a desire to keep Sabbath or Lords Day.
  Students should be encouraged to plan ahead as they would in other areas of life.
  The Dean of Undergradaute or Graduate Studies can resolve any related conflicts with students.
* Some may request too many deadlines in a given week. Strive to find the balance of scaffoleding without micromanaging.
  Part of the rationale for online programs is the flexibility they offer to non-traditional students or to those with complex schedules.
  Overly complex deadline schedules can be hard for students to manage and also challenging to support over time.
