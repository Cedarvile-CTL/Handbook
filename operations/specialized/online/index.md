### Weekly Schedule of Activities

* Courses are typically scheduled around weekly units or modules.
* Weeks begin on Monday and run through Sunday.
* Activities are typically due by 11pm ET on a given day of the week.
* Courses typically have no more than three deadlines in a given week, each usually at least two days apart.
* Weekly deadlines are typically set as Sunday, 11pm unless otherwise discussed.

See [resolutions for related issues](issues.md)

### Grading/Scoring Methods

* We suggest the "grading guide" approach for evaluating student work when practical.
  * Criterion spell out aspects of the submission that will be scored.
  * Points possible indicate the total points that can be awarded but allow the grader to award fractions of that total
    based on their evaluation of the student's work on that criterion.
* We suggest that grading scales be either 10- or 100-points.
  We believe scores on such scales are most easy for students to understand since they relate to a traditional letter grade scale.

*TODO:* A guide for creating grading criterion and scoring systems should accompany this section.
