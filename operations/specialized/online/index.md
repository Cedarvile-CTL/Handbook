### Weekly Schedule of Activities

* Courses are typically scheduled around weekly units or modules.
* Weeks begin on Monday and run through Sunday.
* Activities are typically due by 11pm ET on a given day of the week.
* Courses typically have no more than three deadlines in a given week, each usually at least two days apart.
* Weekly deadlines are typically set as Sunday, 11pm unless otherwise discussed. 
* Weekend deadlines should not be made for Saturdays in lieu of Sundays despite some objections for observance of Sabbath or Lords Day.
  Students should be encouraged to plan ahead and to take up any concerns with the Dean of Undergradaute or Graduate Studies as appropriate.
