Project Management Practice
=====

The Center for Teaching and Learning staff juggle regular project work alongside ongoing support work.
This demands that we carefully predict workload for projects in a way that allows margin for the unexpected.
To help with this, we use a project management and communication system call Podio along with a homegrown planning tool name Eagle.

Practices and policies for these systems are as follows:

1. [Categories of work](categories.md)
2. [Knowledge management](knowledge-management.md)
3. [Workload tracking and planning](workload.md)
