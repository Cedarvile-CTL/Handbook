Managing Project Assets
=======================

We manage our project files (assets) using Google Drive.
This increases our access to the files, helps us share files among devices,
  and makes them linkable from web services like Podio.

We [distinguish between specific course projects, small course updates, and other projects](categories.md),
and our asset management mirrors this.

* Our central Google Drive folder has a Projects directory.
* Each project has its own directory inside Projects. See the section below on naming conventions.
* Each professional discipline that contributes from the team has its own subfolder inside the project folder, including:
  * `content`
  * `media`
  * `design`


Naming conventions
------------------

Project folders must be carefully named with at least two components: the project id and the project name.

* Project id -
  Podio establishes a unique ID number for each course project and other project.
  This number is used along with a prefix of `C-` for full course projects,
    `U-` for smaller updates/course change requestions,
    or `O-` for course or other projects, respectively.
* Project name -
  Other projects simply include the same name as is set up in Podio.
  Course projects and updates require more precision and subdivide this name into up to four parts:
  * Course code -
    This is always the department code in all-caps, a hyphen, and the 4-digit course number. `BTGE-2730` or `VCD-2600`
  * Project scope -
    Based on the definitions provided here, the second part of the name should indicate whether the project is a `Pilot`, `Update`, or `Redesign`.
  * Release term -
    The four-digit year followed immediately by the two- or three-digit semester code. `2016SU1` or `2017SP`
  * Primary SME last name -
    When applicable, the primary SME's last name.

Precise use of these conventions ensures that our folder structure is searchable.
