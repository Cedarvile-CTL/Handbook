Categories of Work
=====

The Center for Teaching and Learning is responsible both for support work and for specific service-oriented projects in a variety of creative medium.


Support Work
-----

### Online Course Support

* *Setup for course offerings* -
  As can be read in more detail under the Online Development and Support section of our specialized services,
  the CTL takes initiativ to set up courses for their offerings each term. This involves setting up all aspects of the courses as well as processing small updates to courses.
* *Training for new faculty* -
  As we set up new online courses, we also keep an eye out for new faculty and reach out to offer orientation
* *Maintenance of courses* -
  Along with regular setup we also take initiative to maintain courses over time.
  These initiatives may be of our own desire to help our courses be as usable and clean as possible.
  Other times they come from clearer administrative initiatives.
  Regardless, we hope to take active part in making Cedarville's online courses be the best they possibly can be.

### Instructional Support

  * *LMS Support* -
    The Instructional Technologist in the CTL is the University's primary knowledge and help base for use of the campus LMS, which is currently Moodle.
    The Admin team from the University IT division is responsible for setup, administration, and other upkeep in the LMS.
    But the CTL is the first point of contact for most matters related to faculty use of the system.
  * *Instructional technologies support* -
    The Instructional Technologist also acts as the point person for support for other technologies used in ongroung and online instruction.
    See our [vision for future services](../../vision.md) for more about what we hope to do in this space in the future.
    This category of support is often a venue to take on new projects.


Project Work
-----

We distinguish primarily between Course projects, Change/Update projects and Other projects.
* Course projects are those larger projects that relate directly to work on a specific course
    and have a deadline associated with the launch of a particular term.
  We further categorize these as:
  * Pilots -
    These are brand new builds of a course in a particular modality, or at least, the first time we've built a course.
  * Redesigns -
    These occur when we rebuild a course that we had built in the past.
    Redesigns involve either a brand new SME who is starting from the ground up,
      or with an existing SME who intends to keep very little of the previous version of the course.
  * Updates -
    These are large updates to an existing course that don't constitute a full redesign.
* Course change requests are smaller updates to courses that represent incremental improvements
    and are requested before particular offerings of a given course.
* Other projects can be either more broad that course projects, or more narrow.
  For example, one such project could be for planning the launch of a new online program (more broad).
  Another could be a small instructional technology research project for a particular need in an onground coure (more narrow).
  They can also be unrelated to courses altogether, such as a department research project, or work assisting a professor with scholarly activities.

Inside of these categories, we have the capacity to complete a wide variety of professional work including content development, instructional media, graphic/web design, and even build custom web applications.

### Content Development

With several staff members possessing strong abilities for proofreading, editing, and several forms of writing, we often aim to assist in developing quality content.
This can be simply taking the time to proof content we receive for online courses rather than just implementing them.
It can also be as complex as assisting a professor with writing a textbook.
More about these services can be found in the corresponding speicalized services sections.
