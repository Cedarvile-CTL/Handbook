Categories of Work
=====

The Center for Teaching and Learning is responsible both for *support work* 
  and for specific service-oriented *projects* in a variety of creative medium.
We also have [a vision for further clarifying](../../../vision.md) our roles in supporting faculty in the future.


Support Work
-----

### Online Course Support

* *Setup for course offerings* -
  As can be read in more detail under the [Online Setup](../../specialized/online/setup.md) section of our specialized services,
    the CTL takes initiative to set up courses for their offerings each term. 
  This involves setting up all aspects of the courses as well as processing small updates to courses.
* *Training for new faculty* -
  As we set up new online courses, we also keep an eye out for new faculty and reach out to offer orientation.
  We piloted an orientation program for new online faculty in 2016 Fall that will continue to be updated over time.
  This relates to broader onboarding processes, with which we're also seeking to refine and improve.
* *Maintenance of courses* -
  Along with regular setup we also take initiative to maintain courses over time.
  These initiatives may be of our own desire to help our courses be as usable and clean as possible.
  Other times they come from clearer administrative initiatives.
  Regardless, we hope to take active part in making Cedarville's online courses be the best they possibly can be.

### Instructional Support

  * *LMS Support* -
    The Instructional Technologist in the CTL is the University's primary knowledge and help base for use of the campus LMS, which is currently Moodle.
    The Admin team from the University IT division is responsible for setup, administration, and other upkeep in the LMS.
    But the CTL is the first point of contact for most matters related to faculty use of the system.
    Thanks to a centralized design process, support for online courses is focused on facilitation support, 
      and works closely with subject matter experts when broader course updates are needed.
    Support for onground faculty is broader, providing hands-on production work, consulting, and training.
  * *Instructional technologies support* -
    The Instructional Technologist also acts as the point person for support for other technologies used in ongroung and online instruction.
    See our [vision for future services](../../../vision.md) for more about what we hope to do in this space in the future.
    This category of support is often a venue to take on new projects and for remaining relevant and service-oriented to the faculty at large.


Project Work
-----

We distinguish primarily between Course projects, Change/Update projects and Other projects.
* **Course projects** are those larger projects that relate directly to work on a specific course
    and have a deadline associated with the launch in a particular term.
  We further categorize these as:
  * Pilots -
    These are brand new builds of a course in a particular modality, or at least, the first time we've built a course.
  * Redesigns -
    These occur when we rebuild a course that we had built in the past.
    Redesigns involve either a brand new SME who is starting from the ground up,
      or with an existing SME who intends to keep very little of the previous version of the course.
  * Updates -
    These are *large* updates to an existing course that quite don't constitute a full redesign.
* **Course change requests** are *smaller* updates to courses that represent incremental improvements
    and are requested before particular offerings of a given course.
* **Other projects** can be either more broader than course projects, or more narrow.
  For example, one such project could be for planning the launch of a new online program (more broad).
  Another could be a small instructional technology research project for a particular need in an onground coure (more narrow).
  They can also be unrelated to courses altogether, such as a department research project, or work assisting a professor with scholarly activities.

Inside of these categories, we have the capacity to complete a wide variety of professional work including 
  content development, instructional media, graphic/web design, and even building custom web applications.

See our [specialized services]() section for more information about these arease of expertise.
