Knowledge Management
=====

With such a variety of interrelated project work and support services,
  we've found out the hard way that we must be intentional to communicate well together.
A key piece of this is having an easy-to-access platform for sharing knowledge on our work and related data.

Since 2012 we have used Podio by Citrix as a knowledge management tool. This system allows us to:
* create custom "apps" or rich, relational spreadsheets to record data about our work.
* post comments on any of these items. This both allows us to externalize our own meeting notes,
  as well as facilitate discussion over the work, since comments are broadcasted to those related to the work.
* create and delegate tasks related to these items.
  This allows us to note actionable tasks, set deadlines, and ensure things actually get done.
* log time on task so as to have a sense of how long things take us
  and therefore, to be better at planning workload in the future.

Much more can and will be said about Podio in the future as it is the key to our operational efficiency.
