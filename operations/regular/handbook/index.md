Handbook Management
===================

It is important that we keep our handbook up to date and also keep a good record of the changes we make over time.
This is why we created this repository to begin with!
Using version control allows us to see line-by-line changes to any portion of our documentation. 

However, in order to ensure things stay neat and clean, the following guidlines should be followed:

* Edit handbook files directly in Github unless you understand how to use more localized version controls.
* Learn how to use the online commit features in Github before editing a document. 
* Use simple, neat markdown based on guides such as [this one](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Place each sentence in a paragraph on its own line so that that line can be tracked using version control.
