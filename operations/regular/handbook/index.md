Handbook Management
===================

It is important that we keep our handbook up to date and also keep a good record of the changes we make over time.
This is why we created this repository to begin with!
Using version control allows us to see line-by-line changes to any portion of our documentation. 

However, in order to ensure things stay neat and clean, the following guidlines should be followed:

* Edit handbook files directly in Github unless you understand how to use more localized version controls.
* Learn how to use the online commit features in Github before editing a document
    and consider also learning to use SourceTree and local text editors such as WebStorm to manage content well.
* Use simple, neat markdown based on guides such as [this one](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Favor == and -- for marking h1 and h2 blocks
* Add complete blank line returns between paragraphs.
* Place each sentence in a paragraph on its own line so that that line can be tracked individually using version control.
  * If individual sentences extend beyond 120 characters, try to make the sentence shorter
      or look for logical breaks in thought and add a line return there (as can be seen in this very sentence).
  * In such cases where the sentence is distributed on multiple lines, indent the subsequent lines with 2 space characters.
